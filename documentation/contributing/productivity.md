# Productivity Notes

1. **Sleep well and sleep enough.** Also, ensure you drink enough water.
2. **Avoid context switching.** Having a user manual can help.
3. **Get rid of realtime communications[^1].** Limit yourself to two weekly meetings and morning emails.
4. **Stay focused.** Address one issue at a time.
5. **Be disciplined.** Don't waste your creativity trying to bend the rules.
6. **Be comfortable.**  Invest in noise-canceling headphones, a height-adjustable desk, and a chair that your back will love.
7. **Don't rush.** You'll make mistakes and be slower.
8. **Don't work overtime.** You'll pay double the next day.
9. **Study.** Listen to what bearded or gray-haired people say.
10. **Be happy.** Meet your friends and family.
