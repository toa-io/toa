# [1.0.0-alpha.272](https://github.com/toa-io/toa/compare/v1.0.0-alpha.271...v1.0.0-alpha.272) (2026-09-01)


* refactor(atomicity)!: take the lock manager from the stash ([4fd91eb](https://github.com/toa-io/toa/commit/4fd91eb2fdb68f7b87aaf16d182794bbc567ba57))
* refactor(exposition)!: meter through the atom ([aa9c8f1](https://github.com/toa-io/toa/commit/aa9c8f16de3f4d315b14c49ff0b4f203053ede2c))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* `context.stash.lock` is gone; lock through `context.atom` instead.
A stash pointer resolving to several addresses now uses the first.

* `context.stash.meter` is gone; meter through `context.atom` instead.
A deployment that declared a stash for `exposition.stash` can drop it, and needs
`atomicity.redis` set for throttling to reconcile.

# [1.0.0-alpha.270](https://github.com/toa-io/toa/compare/v1.0.0-alpha.269...v1.0.0-alpha.270) (2026-08-31)


* feat(exposition)!: throttle by a distributed GCRA ([287eb25](https://github.com/toa-io/toa/commit/287eb254b11339b20ef011deb659eb11f225defe))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* `io:throttle` no longer takes `cooldown`, and its schema now
rejects unknown properties, so a declaration carrying one fails at boot instead of
being ignored quietly. Metering earns the budget back rather than locking a key
out, so the lockout is expressed as a rate: `requests: 20, interval: 600` admits a
burst of twenty and then one every thirty seconds, where `requests: 20, interval:
60, cooldown: 600` used to refuse everything for ten minutes. The stash aspect's
`count` is replaced by `meter`, which takes a batch of keys and debts and answers
what the group has reached.
