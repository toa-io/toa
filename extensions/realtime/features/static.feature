Feature: Static routes

  Scenario: Debug
    Given the `messages` component is running with routes:
      """yaml
      created: [sender, recipient]
      """
    And the stream `004e02a959c04cecaf111827f91caa36` is consumed

  Scenario: Routing an event
    Given the `messages` component is running with routes:
